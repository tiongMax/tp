## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `vdelete 1`, then `edelete 1`. For each command, take note that the `Logic` component will call *both* `saveVolunteerStorage` and `saveEventStorage` since there are some commands that modify both the `eventStorage` and `volunteerStorage`, such as [`eaddv`](UserGuide.md#adding-a-volunteer-into-an-event-eaddv).

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `VolunteerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays both `Volunteer` and `Event` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("vdelete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `VolunteerDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `iVolunteerParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `VolunteerDeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `VolunteerDeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a volunteer).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `iVolunteerParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `EventCreateCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `EventCreateCommand`) which the `iVolunteerParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `VolunteerCreateCommandParser`, `EventDeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

<puml src="diagrams/EventClassDiagram.puml" width="574" />

The `Model` component,

* stores iVolunteer's volunteer and event data i.e., all `Volunteer` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueVolunteerList` object) and all `Event` objects (which can contained in a `UniqueEventList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Volunteer` and `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Volunteer>` and `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save volunteer data, event data, and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `EventStorage`, `VolunteerStorage`, and `UserPrefsStorage`, which means it can be treated as any one of them (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Create Event Feature

#### Implementation
To encapsulate the aspects of an event, a new `Event` class is created. The Event class has fields representing the various aspects of an Event, namely `eventName`, `roles`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `location`, `description`, `materials`, `budget`, and `maxVolunteerSize`. New classes were also created to facilitate the logic of these fields, which are `EventName`, `Role`, `Location`, `Description`, `Material`, `Budget`, and `maxVolunteerSize`.

To store the created events, a new class `EventStorage` is created, which effectively acts as the list storing all created events. A reference to the EventStorage is kept in the ModelManager to facilitate logical operations.

After creating an event, the new EventStorage is saved by converting it to a `JsonSerializableEventStorage` and writing it to the JSON file, `eventStorage.json`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the create event mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1:
The user launches the application and enters the command to create a new event.
`ecreate n/Clean up the beach r/cleaner sd/23/10/23 1900 l/East Coast Park dsc/Pick up all litter on the beach m/10 trash bags b/50.00`. After parsing all the arguments, a new `Event` object is created along with its respective fields.
<puml src="diagrams/EventClassDiagram.puml" alt="EventClassDiagram" />

Step 2:
The created `Event` object is passed to `EventCreateCommand` and executed. During its execution, the application checks the `EventStorage` in the `ModelManager` if an event with the same `eventName` already exists. If not, the new `Event` is added to the `EventStorage`.
<puml src="diagrams/EventCreateSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EventCreateSequenceDiagram" />

Step 3:
When the `EventCreateCommand` finishes executing, the updated `EventStorage` is written into `eventStorage.json` file.
<puml src="diagrams/EventStorageClassDiagram.puml" alt="EventStorageClassDiagram" />


### Design Considerations
**Aspect: How the individual fields of an Event are stored:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create new classes to represent the fields.
    * Pros:
        * Improves the overall structure and readability of the code.
    * Cons:
        * Results in more code. 
        * More memory usage as objects have to be instantiated for each field.

* **Alternative 2:** Store each field as the relevant substring inputted by the user.

    * Pros:
        * Less code required.
        * Less memory usage as objects do not have to be instantiated for each field.
    * Cons:
        * No encapsulation for fields as all fields are treated simply as a string.
        * The Event class will be cluttered with methods as methods specific to each field are compiled into a single class.

**Aspect: How created Events are saved:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save the entire updated `EventStorage`.
    * Pros:
      * Easier to implement
    * Cons:
      * More time is taken to execute the command as the entire `EventStorage` must be saved, compared to just appending the new `Event`.

* **Alternative 2:** Append the `Event` at the end of the JSON file.
    * Pros:
      * The command can be executed quickly as the new `Event` only has to be appended, as compared to saving the entire updated `EventStorage`.
    * Cons:
      * A new method must be created to save data after executing other commands. E.g. The save() method after an edit event command would be different from a create event command as the `Event` would have to be located first in the JSON file and then updated.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedVolunteerStorage` and `VersionedEventStorage`. It extends `VolunteerStorage` and `EventStorage` respectively with an undo/redo history, stored internally as a `versionedVolunteers`, `versionedEvents` and `currentStatePointer`. 

`VersionedVolunteerStorage` implements the following operations:

* `VersionedVolunteerStorage#saveNewState()` — Saves the current volunteers state in its history.
* `VersionedVolunteerStorage#undo()` — Restores the previous volunteers state from its history.
* `VersionedVolunteerStorage#redo()` — Restores a previously undone volunteers state from its history.

`VersionedEventStorage` implements the following operations:

* `VersionedEventStorage#saveNewState()` — Saves the current events state in its history.
* `VersionedEventStorage#undo()` — Restores the previous events state from its history.
* `VersionedEventStorage#redo()` — Restores a previously undone events state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitToBothVersionedStorages()`, `Model#undoBothStorages()` and `Model#redoBothStorages()` respectively.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Any command that changes the volunteers state or events state will trigger the `saveNewState()` method for both `VersionedVolunteerStorage` and `VersionedEventStorage`. Similarly, a `undo` or `redo` command will trigger the `undo()` and `redo()` method for both `VersionedVolunteerStorage` and `VersionedEventStorage`. To avoid diagram repetition, `VersionedVolunteerStorage` will be mainly referred to in the following illustrations. However, take note that whatever happens at `VersionedVolunteerStorage` occurs for `VersionedEventStorage` as well.

</box>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedVolunteerStorage` will be initialized with the initial volunteers state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that `versionedVolunteers` state. Similarly, the `VersionedEventStorage` will be initialized with the initial events state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that `versionedEvents` state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `vdelete 5` command to delete the 5th volunteer in the volunteer list. The `vdelete` command calls `Model#commitToBothVersionedStorages()`, causing the modified state of the volunteer list after the `vdelete 5` command executes to be saved in the `versionedVolunteers`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted `versionedVolunteers` state. Similarly, a new state of the event list will be saved in the `versionedEvents` (although this new state is identical to the previous events state), and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted `versionedEvents` state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `vcreate n/David …​` to add a new volunteer. The `vcreate` command also calls `Model#commitToBothVersionedStorages()`, causing another modified volunteers state to be saved into the `versionedVolunteers`. Similarly, another events state is saved into `versionedEvents`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitToBothVersionedStorages()`, so the volunteers and events state will not be saved into the `versionedVolunteers` and `versionedEvents`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the volunteer was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoBothStorages()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing to the previous volunteers and events state, and restores the volunteer and event list to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial state, then there are no previous states to restore. The `undo` command uses `VersionedVolunteerStorage#canUndoVersionedVolunteers()` and `VersionedEventStorage#canUndoVersionedEvents()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoBothStorages()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the volunteer and event list to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `versionedVolunteers.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest volunteers and events state, then there are no undone states to restore. The `redo` command uses `VersionedVolunteerStorage#canRedoVersionedVolunteers()` and `VersionedEventStorage#canRedoVersionedEvents()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `vlist`. Commands that do not modify the volunteers or events state, such as `vlist`, will not call `Model#commitToBothVersionedStorages()`, `Model#undoBothStorages()` or `Model#redoBothStorages()`. Thus, the `versionedVolunteers` and `versionedEvents` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `vdelete 1`, which calls `Model#commitToBothVersionedStorages()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the latest volunteers and events state, all states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves both the volunteers and events state.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
  
* **Alternative 2:** Selectively save either the volunteer or event storage.
  * Pros: Reduces redundant saves where a state identical to the previous one is saved.
  * Cons: We must identify the correct storage to save, undo, and redo.

* **Alternative 3:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `vdelete`, just save the volunteer being deleted).
  * Cons: Complex to implement. We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.

**Aspect: How to handle current state pointers for both `VersionedVolunteerStorage` and `VersionedEventStorage`:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have separate pointers for both classes, where both pointers increment and decrement simultaneously.
    * Pros: Is a more suitable choice if one were to adopt the **Alternative 2** approach mentioned above. This is because both pointers are now selectively modified, and are not modified in unison.
    * Cons: There is code duplication as the pointers in both classes are handled the same way.

* **Alternative 2:** Have both classes inherit from an abstract `VersionedStorage` class. Thus, they share the same pointer.
    * Pros: Results in cleaner code as common fields and methods from both classes can be extracted out into a parent class.
    * Cons: Harder to implement.

### \[Proposed\] Reading an individual event feature

#### Proposed Implementation

When the app is initialized, the MainApp will first initialize all key components of the app. Specifically in this case:

First, eventToShowList in ModelManager will be initialized, with the list of all events currently in the EventStorage.

Then, when MainWindow is being initialized, the EventShowWindow will also be initialized.

EventShowWindow consists of ListView displaying the eventToShowList in Model, and its contents are obtained by calling Logic.getEventToShowList(), which will call Model.getEventToShowList().

In summary, when the app is initialized, EventShowWindow will be initialized with its contents being the list of all events obtained from the EventStorage. However, user will not see it as without receiving its command, EventShowWindow will not be shown.

### \[In progress\] Delete the event from a list of event

### Implementation

To facilitate the event delete command, the class EventDeleteCommand is created. The class extends from the interface
Command. When the command is then parsed and executed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism of the event delete behaves at each step.

Step 1. When the user input the event delete command, it will be parsed by IVolunteerParser. Then the keyword of the command is noticed and EventDeleteCommandParser is called. 

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteSequenceDiagram" />

Step 2. When the command is parsed, the index of the event in the event list is then determined by parsing from String to an integer.

Step 3. The command is then executed and with the index and the event is deleted from the filtered list.

Step 4. Then the storage will also be updated accordingly by the filtered list.

### Tracking amount of roles and materials

#### Implementation

The mechanism to track the amount of roles and materials within the `Event` class is handled by the `Material` and `Role` classes' `currentQuantity` and `requiredQuantity` fields. Both fields are non-negative integers. In addition, for each class, operations to track, access and update the amount of
each role/material have been added as follows:

- `Role#addRoleManpower()` — Adds 1 to the current quantity of manpower.
- `Role#decreaseRoleManpower()` — Subtracts 1 from the current quantity of manpower.
- `Material#addItems(int addedQuantity)` — Adds `addedQuantity` to the current quantity.
- `Role#hasEnoughManpower()` and `Material#hasEnoughItems()` — Checks if the current quantity ≥ the required quantity.

Like all classes in `Event` and `Volunteer`, `Material` and `Role` classes are **immutable** and any methods that want to modify the behaviour of either object will return a new `Material` or `Role` object with the modified information.

To reflect the `currentQuantity` and `requiredQuantity` fields in `EventStorage`,
every `Role` and `Material` instance will be expressed as a JSON object with the following format:

**Material:**

Relevant Jackson storage class adapted for JSON: [`JsonAdaptedMaterial.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/event/JsonAdaptedMaterial.java)

```json
{
  "material" : "potatoes",
  "currentQuantity" : "20",
  "requiredQuantity" : "75"
}
```

**Role:**

Relevant Jackson storage class adapted for JSON: [`JsonAdaptedRole.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/event/JsonAdaptedRole.java)

```json
{
  "role" : "chef",
  "currentQuantity" : "1",
  "requiredQuantity" : "4"
}
```

This class diagram shows the relationship between `Role`, `Material` and `Event`:

<puml src="diagrams/QuantityClassDiagram.puml" width="400" />

#### Process

This is the process in which a user might track the amount of roles and materials. In this example, the user first adds to the roles, then adds to the materials. Take note that [`ecreate`](UserGuide.md#creating-an-event-ecreate) and [`vcreate`](UserGuide.md#creating-a-new-volunteer-s-profile-vcreate) formats are incomplete for sake of brevity; check their respective user guide entries for the full command.

Step 1. The user runs the command `ecreate n/cook for people r/5 chef m/50 potato ...`. Here, a new `Event` object will be created with a `Set<Role>` that contains 1 `Role` object corresponding to `5 chef` and `Set<Material>` that contains 1 `Material` object corresponding to `50 potato`.

In the constructor to `Role` and `Material` respectively, the `requiredQuantity` for the `:Role` object is **5** and the 
`requiredQuantity` for the `:Material` object is **50**, while the `currentQuantity` are both set to **0**.

**Tracking roles**

Step 2. The user creates a new volunteer using the command `vcreate n/John s/chef...`. This creates a new `Volunteer` object
with name `John` that contains a skill with name `chef`.

Step 3. Assuming both the `Event` and `Volunteer` objects are at the top of their respective lists, the user runs the
command `eaddv eid/1 vid/1` to add the volunteer named `John` to the event named `cook for people`. Given that the `cook for people`
event has a role `chef` and the volunteer `John` has a skill `chef`, iVolunteer will notice and return a new `Role` object with the current quantity **incremented by 1** using `Role#addRoleManpower()`.

Step 4. As a result, the `Role` object will be updated as follows (in the JSON-serialised format):
```json
{
  "role" : "chef",
  "currentQuantity" : "1",
  "requiredQuantity" : "5"
}
```

**Tracking materials**

Step 5. Assuming the `Event` object is at the top of the event list, the user runs command `eaddm eid/1 m/20 potato`. This
results in a `EventAddMaterialCommand` created and then executed, which causes a new `Material` object to be created with the updated current quantity using `Material#addItems()`.

Step 6. As a result, the `Material` object will be updated as follows (in the JSON-serialised format):
```json
{
  "material" : "potato",
  "currentQuantity" : "20",
  "requiredQuantity" : "50"
}
```

### Setting maximum number of volunteers in event

#### Implementation

The feature to set the maximum number of volunteers in an event is facilitated by the `maxVolunteerSize` field within `Event`, which is of type `MaxVolunteerSize`. This is an optional field and not all events need to have a maximum volunteer capacity. The `maxVolunteerSize` field is a non-negative integer of type `long`.

This functionality works on the `EventAddVolunteerCommand`, where the addition of a new volunteer is blocked if the current number of volunteers in the event is equal to `maxVolunteerSize`. The current number of volunteers is computed as follows (abstracted from [actual code](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/eventvolunteercommands/EventAddVolunteerCommand.java) lines 72-75 to ease understanding):

```java
// current volunteer list BEFORE addition of new volunteer
int volunteerListSize = eventToAssign // event to assign volunteer to
        .getAssignedVolunteers()      // get current list of assigned volunteers as an unmodifiable java.util.Set
        .size();                      // get the size of this set (returns an int)
int maxVolunteerSize = eventToAssign  // event to assign volunteer to
        .getMaxVolunteerSize()        // the desired MaxVolunteerSize object
        .maxVolunteerSize;            // get the long value of the maximum volunteer size
boolean eventIsFull = volunteerListSize >= maxVolunteerSize;
if (eventIsFull) {
  // throw an exception that event is full and halt execution
}
```

The activity diagram below shows the general workflow when `EventAddVolunteerCommand` is executed using its `execute()` method, including the checks for `maxVolunteerSize`:
 
<puml src="diagrams/EventAddVolunteerActivityDiagram.puml" alt="EventAddVolunteerActivityDiagram" />

The behaviour exhibited in the code block above is represented by the `[event is full]` branch within the activity diagram.

#### Process

This is the process by which a user might set and undo an event's maximum volunteer count, using the [`ecreate`](UserGuide.md#creating-an-event-ecreate), [`eedit`](UserGuide.md#edit-the-details-of-an-event-eedit) and [`vcreate`](UserGuide.md#creating-a-new-volunteer-s-profile-vcreate). Assume the user starts from an empty volunteer and event list.

**Situation 1: `vs/` parameter in `ecreate` not specified**

Step 1. The user runs the command `ecreate n/cook for people r/5 chef m/50 potato sd/24/12/2023 1400 l/Singapore dsc/cooking food`. Note that the `vs/` parameter is not specified, thus this event will not have a maximum volunteer capacity. Assume this event has index 1 in the event list.

**Situation 2: `vs/` parameter in `ecreate` is specified**

Step 2. The user runs the command `ecreate n/cook for more people r/5 chef m/50 potato sd/24/12/2023 1500 l/Singapore dsc/cooking food vs/1`. Note that the `vs/` parameter is not specified, thus this event will have a maximum volunteer capacity, in this case 1. Assume this event has index 2 in the event list.

Step 3. The user creates 2 volunteers with 2 distinct `vcreate` commands.

**Demonstrating the maximum volunteer limit**

Step 4. The user runs `eaddv eid/2 vid/1`. This should run smoothly. Then the user runs `eaddv eid/2 vid/2`. Due to the limit, an **error message is displayed** stating that you can't add any more volunteers since the event is full.

**Demonstrating editing the max volunteer capacity**

Step 5. The user runs `eaddv eid/1 vid/1`, then `eaddv eid/1 vid/2`. Note that both `eaddv` commands run smoothly due to the lack of limit.

Step 6. The user runs `eedit 1 vs/1`. Since there are already 2 volunteers in the event, the `eedit` command **displays an error message**, stating that you can't set the maximum volunteer limit since there are more volunteers added to the event than the edited limit of 1.

**Demonstrating removing the max volunteer capacity**

Step 7. The user runs `eedit 2 vs/0`. `vs/0` is a special case that removes the maximum volunteer capacity. The `eedit` command runs successfully.

Step 8. The user runs `eaddv eid/2 vid/2`. The volunteer is added successfully due to the removal of the maximum volunteer limit.

### \[Proposed\] vfind feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed vfind mechanism is facilitated by `VolunteerFindCommand`, `VolunteerFindCommandParser` and `SkillNameContainsKeywordsPredicate`. `VolunteerFindCommandParser` extends the interface `Parser`, and it implements the following operation:

* `VolunteerFindCommandParser#parse()` — Processes the user input's arguments.

Meanwhile, `VolunteerFindCommand` extends the abstract class `Command`, and implements the following operation:

* `VolunteerFindCommand#execute()` — Displays the filtered volunteer list.

Lastly, `SkillNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` implements the interface `Predicate`, and implements the following operation:

* `SkillNameContainsKeywordsPredicate#test` — Checks if any `skill` or `name` matches the user input.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the vfind command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The user executes `vfind n/Alex` command to find any volunteers named 'Alex' in the volunteer list. The `vfind` command calls `LogicManager#execute`, which attempts to execute the command. 

Step 2. This creates a `VolunteerFindCommandParser` object, which processes the user input's arguments, namely 'Alex'. This creates a `VolunteerFindCommand` object, with its predicate encapsulating a list of `names` and a list of `skills`.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of volunteers and volunteering events
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: manage volunteers faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app, while making volunteer management easier and more standardised than spreadsheets

## **Appendix: Effort**

Our project, iVolunteer, was based on and forked from the [AddressBook Level-3](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/tp) (AB3) project. We have added around 11k lines of code to the application to adapt the program to support our volunteer management features and to evolve it from the original address book concept.

So far, we found evolving the project to its current form as of v1.4 to be of **moderate difficulty**. This included the process of transforming AB3 to a volunteer and event management application, as well as adding more complex features on top of that.

While AB3 had only 1 `Person` model, iVolunteer has expanded AB3 to contain 2 models (`Volunteer` and `Event`), as well as contained interactions between these two through commands like `eaddv` and `eremovev`. Additional complex features include undo/redo, role and material tracking, and `eshow` for showing events in the UI.

We felt that the project overall were quite consistent in terms of effort. While v1.2 was less effort-intensive due to the benefits of code reuse from AB3, we didn't understand the base code as much and project management was less organised as a result. However, v1.3 was also quite hard due to the implementation of new complex features like volunteer-event interactions, as well as roles and materials tracking.

### Code reuse from AB3

We benefitted from a lot of code reuse from AB3, allowing us to focus on more advanced and complex features more quickly. Here are some parts of our project that were made much easier through reuse:

1. **`Volunteer` class, commands like `vcreate`, `vlist`, `vdelete`, `vfind`**: `Volunteer` as a whole was very similar to the `Person` model in AB3 since they both related to people, with some minor modifications. Likewise, the commands were very similar to implement, helping us save a lot of time implementing the create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations for volunteers. However, we removed the `Address` class and field from the `Volunteer` model which took quite a bit of refactoring to implement.
2. **`Event` class**: We adapted the `Person` model in AB3 by changing relevant fields in order to create the `Event` model. Some fields like `startDate`, `endDate`, and `budget` introduced new types of validation that we needed to introduce, making implementation non-trivial. However, overall the general `Event` class was quite similar to `Person` so we worked on a clone of the `Person` model to create the `Event` model.

1. Prerequisites: List all events using the `elist` command. Multiple events in the list.

    1. Test case: `efind n/fixing computers`<br>
       Expected: Event list is updated to show `fixing computers` event. Number of matching events shown in the status message.

    1. Test case: `efind n/this event does not exist`<br>
       Expected: Event list displays nothing. `0 events listed!` shown in the status message.

    1. Test case: `efind n/!@#`<br>
       Expected: Event list displays nothing. `Names should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces, and it should not be blank` shown in the status message.

    1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `efind`, `efind randomwordshere n/baking cookies`, `...` <br>
       Expected: `Invalid command format!` error message shown in the status message. Instructions on the correct format are shown as well.
   
### Undoing/redoing a command

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** To simulate a scenario where undo/redo can be used, the test cases below are ran sequentially.

</box>

1. Prerequisites: List all events and volunteers. Multiple events and volunteers in the list.

   1. Test case: `vdelete 1`<br>
      Expected: First volunteer is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted volunteer shown in the status message.

   1. Test case: `ecreate n/eating food r/5 cooker r/5 eaters sd/12/5/2023 0900 ed/14/5/2023 1200 l/punggol dsc/eating food m/50 burgers b/100.00`<br>
      Expected: Event is created and added to the event list. Details of the event shown in the status message.

   1. Test case: `undo` (run it twice)<br>
      Expected: First, `eating food` event is removed from the event list. Then, the first volunteer is added back to the volunteer list. `Undo command success` shown in the status message.
   
   1. Test case: `undo`<br>
      Expected: Nothing happens. `Cannot undo any further` shown in the status message.

   1. Test case: `redo` (run it twice)<br>
      Expected: First, the first volunteer is deleted from the volunteer list. Then, the `eating food` event is added back to the event list. `Redo command success` shown in the status message.

   1. Test case: `redo`<br>
      Expected: Nothing happens. `Unable to redo` shown in the status message.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
1. Currently, the duplicate detection for roles and materials within the Event model are not very effective: roles and materials with the same name but different quantities are *not counted* as duplicates (e.g. `2 / 50 farmers` and `3 / 100 farmers` are not considered duplicate roles). While the program works perfectly fine with the duplicate roles/materials, we are planning to:
   - strengthen the duplicate detection such that any two roles or materials with the same name are counted as duplicates (e.g. `2 / 50 farmers` and `3 / 40 farmers` will now be considered duplicates)
   - produce an error message `There is more than 1 role/material with the same name: [ROLE/MATERIAL NAME]!` whenever there is a duplicate role/material such that volunteer coordinators are aware of these duplicates and fix the respective `ecreate` or `eedit` command.
   - **Example:** With these changes, the command `ecreate n/Learn farming r/30 farmers r/40 farmers r/100 participants sd/18/11/2023 1230 l/lim chu kang dsc/learn farming` will produce the error message `There is more than 1 role with the same name: farmers!` since `r/30 farmers` and `r/40 farmers` are duplicates.
